This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Build MCP Servers**: The MCP servers (coder-agent and qa-agent) need to be built before running the web app, as they are executed as child processes:

```bash
# From the project root
cd packages/coder-agent
npm install
npm run build

cd ../qa-agent
npm install
npm run build
```

2. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Running the Development Server

After building the MCP servers, run the development server:

```bash
# From apps/web directory
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Note on MCP Servers

**You do NOT need to manually run the MCP servers.** They are automatically started as child processes by the web application when needed (via `StdioClientTransport`). However, they must be built first (see Prerequisites above).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
